        <p class="body-large">A strong developer experience has always been a core part of Auth0’s DNA. Since our founding we have deliberately built a developer-first product and it continues to be a key part of our success to this day. Naturally, maintaining excellent developer documentation is an essential part of our strategy.

        <h2>Auth0 Docs: Love ‘em or Hate ‘em</h2>
        <p>We had gotten a lot of feedback over the years from the developer community that our docs were fantastic and they were frequently cited as being a competitive differentiator.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we also got a lot of feedback that our docs were terrible and difficult to navigate.</p>

            <h2>Discovery Interviews</h2>
            <p>To determine why some people loved our docs while other people hated them, I began conducting discovery interviews with our customers. </p>
            <p>In general I learned that: </p>
            <h3>Developers who liked our docs</h3>
            <p>Had more pre-existing IAM knowledge
                Relied more on Google searches to find docs or community forum posts</p>
            <h3>Developers who hated our docs</h3>
            <p>Had less IAM knowledge
                Relied more on our sidebar navigation because they didn’t know the concepts well enough to choose good search terms
                Ended up jumping back and forth between loads of tabs</p>
            </div>

                        <p class="body-small">7 software engineers with varying levels of experience with Auth0</p>
                        <p class="overline-small">Process</p>
                        <p class="body-small">Participants were interviewed about where they struggled with Auth0 docs, what they liked about Auth0 docs, and what they look for in developer documentation in general.</p>

    <h2>Making Sense of the Mess</h2>
    <p>I performed a content audit of all 1000+ pages of docs, putting together a massive spreadsheet highlighting the problems in the IA. (I am precisely the kind of nerd who finds this sort of task highly enjoyable.</p>
    <p>The biggest issue was that our sidebar navigation was manually generated, but our breadcrumbs were automatically generated based on the file structure of our CMS. Over time the two had diverged, leading to a number of mismatches.</p>
