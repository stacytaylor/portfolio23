            <p class="body-large">A strong developer experience has always been a core part of Auth0’s DNA. Since our founding we have deliberately built a developer-first product and it continues to be a key part of our success to this day. Naturally, maintaining excellent developer documentation is an essential part of our strategy.

        <h2>Auth0 Docs: Love ‘em or Hate ‘em</h2>
                <p>We had gotten a lot of feedback over the years from the developer community that our docs were fantastic and they were frequently cited as being a competitive differentiator.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we also got a lot of feedback that our docs were terrible and difficult to navigate.</p>

        <p>Stakeholder Objection:
            We should focus on SEO instead of IA because 70% of our traffic comes from search.</p>

            <p>Stakeholder Objection:
                Overhauling the IA will take too long and we may need to shift priorities partway through the project.</p>

                <p>Stakeholder Objection:
                    IA is boring and we should focus on something more visual and impactful, like a homepage redesign.</p>

            <h2>Discovery Interviews</h2>
            <p>To determine why some people loved our docs while other people hated them, I began conducting discovery interviews with our customers. </p>
            <p>In general I learned that: </p>
            <h3>Developers who liked our docs</h3>
            <p>Had more pre-existing IAM knowledge
                Relied more on Google searches to find docs or community forum posts</p>
            <h3>Developers who hated our docs</h3>
            <p>Had less IAM knowledge
                Relied more on our sidebar navigation because they didn’t know the concepts well enough to choose good search terms
                Ended up jumping back and forth between loads of tabs</p>
