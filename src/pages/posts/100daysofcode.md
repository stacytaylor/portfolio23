On December 20, 2019 I decided to get a head start on one of my goals for 2020 - completing the 100 days of code challenge. The idea behind the challenge is simple - code for at least an hour a day, every day, for 100 days. You can code in any language or languages you want to learn, and your learning plan can be as structured or unstructured as you like. Check our some of the project I did on [my project page](https://radcode.netlify.app/).

Here’s roughly how mine broke down:

Days 1- 3
Responsive Web Design on [freecodedamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

Days 4 - 17
Javascript on [freecodedamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

Days 18 - 21
Frontend libraries on [freecodedamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

Days 22 - 24
CSS layouts course on [designcode.io](https://designcode.io/)

Days 25 - 27
Greensock animation course on [designcode.io](https://designcode.io/)

Days 29 - 32
React for Designers course on [designcode.io](https://designcode.io/)

Days 33 - 40
Creative Coding course on [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/)

Days 43 - 52
Experimental JavaScript course on on [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/)

Days 53 - 65
Random [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/) tutorials and working on [my project page](https://radcode.netlify.app/)

Days 66 - 76
Experimental JavaScript course on on [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/)

Days 77 - 88
Ajax and APIs course on on [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/)

Days 89 - 98
JavaScript for Designers course on [SueprHi](https://www.superhi.com/)

Days 99-100
Putting the finishing touches on [my project page](https://radcode.netlify.app/)

In the past 100 days I’ve:
Learned a lot of JavaScript
Gotten more comfortable with HTML and CSS
Learned tools like Git, Github, Netlify, Hyper, VS Code, Contentful, and various APIs
Learned a little bit of Sass, Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Greensock, Web GL, and Ajax
Experimented with different JavaScript libraries, including two.js, three.js, matter.js, and PIXI.js.

What’s next?
I need a bit of a break from the daily hustle right now, but I’m nowhere near done learning.
I still have a handful of SuperHi courses to finish, plus a new course launching this month I want to take.
I’d also like to do the JS 30 at some point, and possibly some sort of CSS challenge as well.
I want to spend more time working on projects that don’t involve following tutorials, and will probably start by using my new skills to update my portfolio.
Sounds like that might be enough for another 100 day challenge...Stay tuned!
