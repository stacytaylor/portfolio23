Last summer, I set out to complete my first hundred day challenge and decided to start with vector illustrations for a few reasons:

ðŸŽ¨ To improve my illustration skills

ðŸ–‹ To get more proficient with the pen tool

ðŸŽ¯ To set a big goal and stick to it

## So what did I learn?
Thereâ€™s no right time to start. Start anyway.
I wasted a few months just waiting for the perfect time to get started. Yâ€™know, just a 3 month+ block of time where I wouldnâ€™t be traveling or busy with any other possible commitments. Right. Because that exists. Turns out thereâ€™s no such thing as the perfect time to start something like this. The trick to finishing is to get started anyway.

That being said, late May ended up being a pretty awful time to start the challenge. My summer seemed fairly open at that point, but then I enrolled in a drawing class at my local community college, became friends with a few of my neighbors and spent most of my evenings hanging out with them, and oh, yeah, made the impulsive decision to move to a new apartment. Life got a little hectic.

### I should have plannedâ€¦a little more than I did.
I started with a general idea for some of the illustrations I wanted to do and figured Iâ€™d just get inspired with other ideas along the way.

A lot of days I ended up drawing something based on what Iâ€™d done that day, or because it was some sort of holiday. On the one hand, itâ€™s kind of cool to look back and remember how much fun I had at the Oregon Brewers Festival on day 47 or that my catâ€™s birthday was on day 54. But there were also many, many days when I found myself sitting in front of the computer at 10pm trying to figure out what in the heck I should draw.

If I were to do the challenge again, Iâ€™d make more of an effort to plan my illustrations, or at least determine a set of themes I could follow â€” 10 days of food, 10 days of animals, etc. It would have made getting started each day easier and would have made for a more cohesive end product.

### Motivation is fickle.
Sticking with this challenge was tougher than I expected. Most days I didnâ€™t get around to starting the illustration until late in the evening. It started feeling like an obligationâ€¦something I had to cross off my list so I could go to bed. There were a lot of days where I just decided to phone it in and do something simple. Which in turn made it even harder to stay motivated because I felt like I wasnâ€™t challenging myself or improving my skills so what was the point? Looking back over the illustrations I created, itâ€™s clear that my skills did improve over time. More importantly, though, I no longer view illustrating as something Iâ€™m incapable of doing. Now when I need an illustration for a project I have the confidence that I can create something at least passable.

### Thereâ€™s nothing quite like the satisfaction of finishing.
I didnâ€™t finish the challenge in 100 days. There were a handful of days I ended up skipping due to moving, camping, being sick, etc. But I did finish â€” just a few weeks later than anticipated. And I gotta tell you, the sense of accomplishment I got was incredible.

Spending 100 days actively practicing a craft is one of the most empowering things Iâ€™ve ever done.

We all know that practice and consistency are the keys to improving any skill, yet itâ€™s so easy to let our time slip away watching Netflix and scrolling social media instead. Finishing the challenge taught me that I have what it takes to spend time growing my skills every single day and that itâ€™s something worth prioritizing. I knew even before I finished that my first hundred day challenge would not be my last.
