<div class="main-content">

  <p>I’m a seasoned product designer with experience working on SaaS products and developer tools at companies like Honeycomb.io, Auth0, and Intel.</p>

  <p>As a former librarian, I have a strong background in information architecture and user research and I’m always thinking about how to get users the right information at the right time. I’m a systems thinker and I love digging into a good content audit or user journey to connect the individual pieces of a product to a holistic end-to-end experience.</p>

    <p>I’ve also led several initiatives in the areas of inclusive design and accessibility. In my time at Auth0, I spearheaded a company-wide effort to remove biased language from our code base and communications, and created training materials to promote inclusive design. I also hold a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies certification from the International Association of Accessibility Professionals and worked on a task force to improve accessibility across the Auth0 product.
    </p>

      <p>My dedication to design extends beyond my day job.  I volunteer as a mentor with Out in Tech, an organization dedicated to promoting LGBTQIA+ diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. In addition, I served on the board of CHIFOO, the Computer-Human Interaction Forum of Oregon for four years. As a board member, I worked to promote understanding and awareness of the complex relationship between humans and technology, and to help shape the future of the tech industry in the Portland area.</p>

        <p>Outside of work I can usually be found exploring the Pacific Northwest with my faithful canine companion, Rufus, or curled up on the couch with a good book.</p>
